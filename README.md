# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwindcss + Iconify + Shadcn/ui

This is a test portfolio project built in the above dependencies.  
Mostly using tailwind for styling and some iconify icons. Shadcn/ui for buttons.  
  
I plan to make another portfolio that is more original in the future, as this one was built 60% using help from a guide. It was a great learning experience and taught me a lot about mobile-friendly design.
